# **Push_Swap**
---------------------------

Push Swap is a sorting algorithm that takes two stacks (like two boxes) and only use them to <br>
sort data in order back in stack A or (one box). You can only sort data by using certain moves <br>
For Example: Swap 1st and last positions on Stack A and/or swap first 2 of Stack A etc <br>
It sorts numbers in Ascending order <br>

**TO RUN**
>Enter "make re" <br>
>Enter "sh perf.sh" <br>
>Defaultly it will Do 10 test's with 100 values <br>
>It will display avg: (moves) at end - if its less than 1000 it was good. <br>
>If it was less than 900 it performed really good. <br>
>open perf.sh  and chenge first value (num = ?) to set stack amount <br>
>You can run push_swap without tester: ./push_swap -v 1 5 4  (enter values instead of 1 5 4, no duplicates)
